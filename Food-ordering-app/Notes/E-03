** **Laying the Foundation** **
- Create a script that will build our project

- React Element is basically an object. When we render it into the DOM, it becomes an HTML element.

- JSX is separate from react and it makes the developers life easy.
- JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax. JSX IS NOT HTML IN JS.

- JS cannot read HTML. When we write this code, it is transpiled before it reaches the JS engine that receives the code that browsers can understand.
- Parcel is managing the task of transpilation which it gives to **Babel**.
- JSX (Babel transpiles) => React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
- Babel = JS compiler. can transpile the code from one form to a compatible form (browser, etc)

# React Component
- Two types:
1. Class based Component -  OLD
2. Functional Component - NEW

# React Functional Component
- Normal javascript function which returns some JSX. Naming convention - should always start with a capital letter.

# Component Composition
- using a component inside another component

- Prevents cross-site scripting. JSX sanitizes everything before executing it!
